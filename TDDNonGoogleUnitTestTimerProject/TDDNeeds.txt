Steps for timer in TDD:



- Does a function X amount of times
- Measure time before and after this function
- Captures the elapsedTime as many times as the function in a vector
- cuts off the lowest and highest 5% (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/winsorization/)
- can return the current average of times
- can reset to a neutral starting state
